# PlayGround

This repository is to practice with the use of the github GUI. It will be used during the Github training to practice with creating pull requests, creating issues etc. 

Main difference with the Harmonie repository is that all Hirlam members have write access to the PlayGround repo and can therefore merge their own pull request.

# Exercise 1 (Pull Request) 

1. Create a fork of the PlayGround repository by clicking fork at the top right. 
2. Go to the fork in your personal github and create a new branch `feature/mypullrequest`
3. Navigate to the `IcandoPRs` directory and create a new file by click `Add File` -> `Create new file`. Use your Github username as the filename  
4. Commit your changes and start a pull request
5. Go to the main repo, add a milestone, labels and leave a comment
6. Go back to your fork and make some changes to the file you just created and commit. 
7. Go back to the main repo and see that the new commit is now part of the pull request.   
8. Merge the PR using `Squash and Merge` and note that we get a single commit in the main repo.
