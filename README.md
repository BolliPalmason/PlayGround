# PlayGround

This repository is to practice with the use of the github GUI. It will be used during the Github training to practice with creating pull requests, creating issues etc. 

https://hirlam.github.io/HarmonieSystemDocumentation/dev/System/GitDeveloperDocumentation/

# Exercise 1 (Pull Request) 

1. Create a fork of the PlayGround repository by clicking fork at the top right. 
2. Go to the fork in your personal github and create a new branch `feature/mypullrequest`
3. Navigate to the `IcandoPRs` directory and create a new file by click `Add File` -> `Create new file`. Use your Github username as the filename  
4. Commit your changes and start a pull request
5. Go to the main repo, add a milestone, labels and leave a comment
6. Go back to your fork and make some changes to the file you just created and commit. 
7. Go back to the main repo and see that the new commit is now part of the pull request.   
8. The PR will be merged using `Squash and Merge`. This will squash all commits in the PR to a single commit in the Hirlam:PlayGround epo. 

# Exercise 2 (Keep your fork up to date using the GUI) 

After others have succesfully merged their PRs in exercise 1 and you navigate to your PlayGround fork. You will see a message 

This branch is x commits behind Hirlam:PlayGround.

1. Click "fetch upstream" to get the latest commits from the Hirlam:PlayGround develop branch into your fork. 


See https://hirlam.github.io/HarmonieSystemDocumentation/dev/System/GitDeveloperDocumentation/ for an alternative way to keep your fork up to date using the command line
